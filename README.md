# SSR-conditional-score
R Code for the article "A new conditional performance score for the evaluation of adaptive group sequential designs with sample size recalculation" by Carolin Herrmann, Maximilian Pilz, Meinhard Kieser and Geraldine Rauch (doi: 10.1002/sim.8534). 

* **What the project does**: \
This is the R code used for the simulations in the manuscript "A new conditional performance score for the evaluation of adaptive group sequential designs with sample size recalculation" (doi: 10.1002/sim.8534).

* **Why the project is useful**: \
In the above-mentioned article, the authors propose a conditional performance score that combines different performance measures for the evaluation and comparison of sample size recalculation rules. 

* **How users can get started with the project**: \
Download all the uploaded R-files and open "Main.R" where you can specify the parameters for the simulations. Moreover, specify your path to the program in “Main.R”, “cond_score.R”, “optfunc_design.R” and “promising_design.R”.

* **Where users can get help with your project**: \
Background knowledge on the implemented theory can be found in "A new conditional performance score for the evaluation of adaptive group sequential designs with sample size recalculation" (doi: 10.1002/sim.8534).

* **Who maintains and contributes to the project**: \
The code was written by Carolin Herrmann and Geraldine Rauch.
